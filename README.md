# sftdyn dynamic dns server

`sftdyn` is a minimalistic dynamic DNS server that accepts update requests via HTTP(S) and forwards them to a locally running DNS server via `nsupdate -l`.

It lets you easily create a dyndns.org-like service, using your own DNS server, and can (probably) be used with your router.

## Operation

* Some device submits a https request to a "secret URL" of `sftdyn`
* From this, `sftdyn` knows the request origin IP
* From the "secret URL", `sftdyn` updates the DNS record of the associated hostname
* The request therfore updated an IP in your zone


## Requirements

* [Python >=3.5](https://www.python.org/)
* [`aiohttp`](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/)


## Quick Guide

`sftdyn` is for you if you host a DNS zone and can run a Python server so it updates the nameserver records.
This guide assumes that you're using bind, your zone is `dyn.sft.mx`, and your server's IP is `12.345.678.90`.
Substitute the correct values for zone and IP as you use this guide.


### Nameserver

`bind` has to be configured to serve the updatable zone.

Somewhere in `named.conf`, add

```
zone "dyn.sft.mx" IN {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/dyn.sft.mx.zone";
    journal "/var/cache/bind/dyn.sft.mx.zone.jnl";
    update-policy local;
};
```

`/var/cache/bind` must be writable for *bind*.

Create the empty zone file

```
cp /etc/bind/db.empty /etc/bind/dyn.sft.mx.zone
```

If you want to use `dyn.sft.mx` as the hostname for your update requests, add a record to the zone file:

```
@ IN A 12.345.678.90
@ IN AAAA some:ipv6::address
```


### sftdyn

To install *sftdyn*, use `pip install sftdyn` or `./setup.py install`.

Launch it with `python3 -m sftdyn [command-line options]`.

Configuration is by command-line parameters and conf file.
A sample conf file is provided in `etc/sample.conf`.
If no conf file name is provided, `/etc/sftdyn/conf` is used.
Hostnames/update keys are specified in the conf file.

#### systemd service

To run `sftdyn` automatically, you can use a systemd service.

The `sftdyn` distribution package should automatically install `sftdyn.service`.

If you have to manually install it, use the example unit `etc/sftdyn.service`
and copy it to `/etc/systemd/system/sftdyn.service` on the `sftdyn` host machine.

Enable the launch on boot and also start `sftdyn` now:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now sftdyn.service
```

#### Unencrypted operation

You _can_ use `sftdyn` in plain HTTP mode.
Your average commercial dynamic DNS provider provides a HTTP interface, so most routers only support that.

Somebody could grab your "secret url" with this and perform unintended updates of your record.


#### Encrypted operation

Because of the above reason, you _should_ use HTTPS to keep your update url token secret.
For that, your server needs a X.509 key and certificate.
You can create those with [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), buy those somewhere, or create a self-signed one.

##### Self-signed certificate

To generate `server.key` and a self-signed `server.crt` valid for 1337 days:

```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 1337 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
rm server.csr
```

Make sure you enter your server's domain name for _Common Name_.

`sftdyn` _should_ run under the same user as your DNS server, or it _might_ not be able to update it properly.


### Client

The client triggers the IP update at the `sftdyn` server, so your DNS then delivers the correct IP.

#### Plastic router

To use your router as client, select _user-defined provider_, enter http://dyn.sft.mx:8080/yourupdatekey as the update URL, and random stuff as domain name/user name/password. (tested with my AVM Fritz!Box. YMMV). Most routers don't support HTTPS update requests (especially not with custom CA-cert, so you'll probably need HTTP.

#### Request with `curl`

If you want to update the external IP of some network, and a machine in that network can use `curl`, choose this client method.

If you use HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, `curl` will refuse to talk to the server.
 - Use `curl -k` to ignore the error (Warning: see the security considerations below).
 - Copy `server.crt` to the client, and use `curl --cacert server.crt`.

| HTTP code     | Text          | Response interpretation             |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 200           | OK            | Update successful                   |
| 200           | UPTODATE      | Update unneccesary                  |
| 403           | BADKEY        | Unknown update key                  |
| 500           | FAIL          | Internal error (see the server log) |
| 200           | _your ip_     | Returned if no key is provided      |

##### systemd timer

`systemd` timers are like cronjobs. Use them to periodically run the update query.

Create `/etc/systemd/system/sftdynupdate.timer`:
```
[Unit]
Description=SFTdyn dns updater

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:0/15
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Create `/etc/systemd/system/sftdynupdate.service`:
```
[Unit]
Description=SFTdyn name update

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=nobody
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env curl -f -s --cacert /path/to/server.crt https://dyn.sft.mx:4443/yoursecretupdatekey
```

Activate the timer firing with:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now sftdyn.timer
```

Verify the timer is scheduled:

```
sudo systemctl list-timers
```

To manually trigger the update (e.g. for testing purposes):

```
sudo systemctl start sftdyn.service
```

##### Cronjob

Cronjobs are the legacy variant to periodically run a task, you could do this like this:

```
*/10 * * * * curl https://dyn.sft.mx:4443/mysecretupdatekey
```


## About

This software was written after the free `dyndns.org` service was shut down.
After a week or so of using plain `nsupdate`, I was annoyed enough to decide to write this.

It is the main goal to stay as minimal as possible; for example, I deliberately didn't implement a way to specify the hostname or IP that you want to update; just a simple secret update key is perfectly good for the intended purpose. If you feel like it, you can make the update key look like a more complex request; every character is allowed. Example: `?host=test.sft.mx&key=90bbd8698198ea76`.

The conf file is interpreted as python code, so you can do arbitrarily complex stuff there.

## Security considerations

- When using HTTP, or if your `server.key` has been stolen or broken, an eavesdropper can steal your update key, and use that to steal your domain name.
- When using HTTPS with `curl -k`, a man-in-the-middle can steal your update key.
- When using HTTPS with a paid certificate, a man-in-the-middle with access to a CA can steal your update key (no problem for government agencies, but this is pretty unlikely to happen).
- When using HTTPS with a self-signed certificate and `curl --cacert server.crt`, no man-in-the-middle can steal your update key.

`sftdyn` is pretty minimalistic, and written in python, so it's unlikely to contain any security vulnerabilities. The python ssl and http modules are used widely, and open-source, so there _should_ be no security vulnerabilities there.

Somebody who knows a valid udpate key could semi-effectively DOS your server by spamming update requests from two different IPs. For each request, nsupdate would be launched and your zone file updated.

## Development

IMHO, the project is feature-complete; it has everything that **I** currently need.

If you have any requests, ideas, feedback or bug reports,
are simply filled with pure hatred,
or just need help getting the damn thing to run,
join our chatroom and just ask:

- IRC: `irc.freenode.net/#sfttech`
- Matrix: `#SFTtech:matrix.org`


If you actually _did_ implement a useful feature, please send a pull request; I'd be happy to merge it.
